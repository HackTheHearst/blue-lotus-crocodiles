## The project
How do archaeologists make sense of what they find?

Part of archaeology is seeking to understand artifacts’ “context.” How do an object’s location, and its relationship to other objects, help an archaeologist or art historian create theories about its meaning?

It’s also fun to think about how our own lives relate to ancient lives. We have to be careful, though, to avoid painting cultural biases from our own times onto other cultures – past or present. But this is hard to resist, because the very questions we ask reflect our own culture. Sometimes, though, comparisons provide a starting place for making connections with ancient puzzle pieces. On this page, you can start to think like an archaeologist! Talk with your teacher and classmates to make theories about how objects on this page relate to the other objects near them.

We provided you with some classroom questions to get you started. If you don’t know the answers to the questions, try to find the answers together in books or on the Internet with your teacher. You could also write to an archaeologist at a museum or university if you cannot find an answer. Archaeologists love hearing from young people who are 
interested in their field of study!

## Technologies
Time Capsule is an educational tool with two components: a matching game intended to stimulate the student's learning, and a teacher-guided activity to make sense of Ancient Egyptian life. The application is built with Flask, a Python web framework, and uses jQuery and d3.js for the interactive features.

## Installation
To run the application with your computer as a server, you'll need Python installed. First, clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/angelausy/blue-lotus-crocodiles.git

Next, create a virtual environment for the application and its dependencies:

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install flask
    pip install -r requirements.txt
